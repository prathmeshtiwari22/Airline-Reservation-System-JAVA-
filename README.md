# Airline Reservation System in Java

## Introduction

The Airline Reservation System is a Java-based application that allows users to book flights, manage reservations, and obtain information about available flights. This system is designed to streamline the process of airline reservations and provide a user-friendly interface for passengers.

## Features

- **Flight Booking:** Users can search for available flights based on criteria like source, destination, date, and class. They can select a flight and book tickets.

- **Reservation Management:** Passengers can view and manage their reservations. This includes canceling reservations, changing flight details, and updating personal information.

- **Flight Information:** The system provides detailed information about available flights, including departure and arrival times, ticket prices, and seat availability.

- **User Authentication:** Users can create accounts, log in, and maintain their profiles. This enables a personalized experience and the ability to track booking history.

- **Payment Processing:** The system can handle secure payment processing for flight bookings, ensuring that transactions are safe and reliable.

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** The core programming language for building the application.
- **Java Swing:** For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **MySQL:** To store and manage flight information, user profiles, and reservations.
- **Java Database Connectivity (JDBC):** For connecting the Java application to the MySQL database.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. If not, download and install it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

3. Set up a MySQL database to store flight information and user data. You can use tools like phpMyAdmin or MySQL Workbench for this.

4. Update the database connection settings in the Java code to match your MySQL database configuration.

5. Compile and run the Java program. You may use an integrated development environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA, or run the program via the command line.

## Usage
